# PowerChain Blockchain Solution&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/passlickdev/powerchain.svg?token=pYSRUkhcJkH5kPyosazr&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/passlickdev/powerchain)

Simple fully-integrated blockchain solution, optimized for versatility, performance and security. Cross-platform (works on Windows, Linux and macOS), built on .NET Core and written in C#. Developed by Passlick Development.

## Functions

This software is currently in an early alpha state. At this state, the PowerChain blockchain solution only handles _local_ blockchains and is not ready to maintain a functioning blockchain network. You can generate, load, save and validate a local blockchain, represented by an object of the class `Blockchain`, which consists of blocks represented by objects of the class `Block`. It's also possible to add data to and get data from a _local_ blockchain. The local blockchain is stored in a JSON file called `blockchain.json`. Currently, the solution lacks an implementation of a proof-of-work algorithm.  

__Feel free to help this software becoming a great blockchain solution by adding code and submitting push requests!__ 

<br>

### Current functions:
- Initialize a new blockchain, including the _Genesis block_
- Load a local blockchain from a file (`blockchain.json`)
- Save a blockchain to a JSON file
- Validate the integrity of a blockchain
- Add data (`str`) to a blockchain
- Get data from a blockchain (by hash)

### Functions in-development:
- Proof-of-work algorithm for adding data to a blockchain
- Ability to maintain a strong blockchain network with multiple peers and/or miners (p2p/server-based)
- Add your own functions! :smile:

### Arguments
You can pass arguments either as a parameter when starting the application (`/[ARGUMENT]`) or within the in-application CLI (`[ARGUMENT]`). Every argument can be either passed in upper or lower cases.

| __Argument (parameter)__ | __Argument (CLI)__ |                                                                                     __Definition__                                                                                     |
